              When quizzed during a speech in his most recent national tour,
              Obasanjo, Nigerian past president, made an intriguing statement
              that offers great insight about his journey on how he rose to
              become the president of Nigeria from a lowly, impoverished farm
              boy in Ogun state, Nigeria.

              “I joined the military” he said. “Shortly after, Nigeria gained
              independence. Then, suddenly, there was an even ground to play
              on”.

              This is an incredibly insightful statement to which a discerning

              To Obasanjo and his contemporaries in their time, the army was the
              even ground providence provided. It was the even ground that
              erased and removed all societal and aristocratic blockades set in
              place to frustrate and keep the ordinary man ordinary. The army
              was what provided an even ground for their generation to play on.
              An even ground where what mattered was abilities and capabilities;
              not statuses and connections.

              Technology has removed all obstacles and barricades that was

              Today, anyone, anywhere, can pick up a computer, put himself under
              strict training, and emerge after a few years, with skills that
              will put him on par with any other “privileged” person of our

              and inconsistencies of the government. Harnessing the limitless
              capabilities afforded us by recent advancement in technologies,
